<h2>Client report</h2>
<p>I chose my photos and content by having an idea of what i wanted my website to look like and found those images online. For the content I had AI give me some basic steps for guitar maitnence</p>
<a href="evetucke.github.io/wdd130-vanderkooi/">evetucke.github.io/wdd130-vanderkooi/</a>
<p>The site works great but for some reason i can only see the main page.</p>
<h2>Lead developer</h2>
<p>This was a mess. I didn't get the files till about two days before this project was due and there was no content or really a site plan.</p>
<a href="https://s23hvanderkooi.github.io/Proposal/Elevator_pitch.html">https://s23hvanderkooi.github.io/Proposal/Elevator_pitch.html</a>
<p>This was pretty much all I got</p>
<h2>Junior developer</h2>
<p>I communicated with my lead developers through email as well as in person</p>
<p>I knew what was expected with me and I contributed by completing my sites</p>
<p>No problems with GitHub</p>

<h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
<p>The most challenging part of this project was the communication as well as coding. I did my best with what I was given</p>
<p>It was really fun seeing the websites come together</p>
<p>if I could do something better I would code more effiecently</p>
<p>I have a lot more condidence coding then I did before this class</p>
